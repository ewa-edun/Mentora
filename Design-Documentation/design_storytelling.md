# Storytelling & Illustration Approach

## Why Storytelling?
Mentora isn’t just a tool—it’s an adventure. Every interaction is shaped to feel like a supportive journey, not a task.

## Illustration Strategy
- **Characters**: Friendly AI mentors of all backgrounds, animals, and magical creatures that kids can relate to.
- **Scenes**: Whimsical classrooms, enchanted forests, cozy study nooks.
- **Colors**: Use core brand palette for warmth and playfulness.
- **Medium**: Flat vector illustrations with subtle gradients, no harsh lines.

## Storytelling in UX
- **Onboarding:** New users “meet” their AI guide, who explains features in a fun, narrative way.
- **Empty States:** Instead of “no data,” users see a character offering encouragement or tips.
- **Voice Feedback:** Voice responses have a narrative arc (greet → guide → encourage).

## Example: Onboarding Flow
“Hi! I’m Mento, your magical study friend. Let’s set up your learning journey together.”

## Accessibility in Stories
- All illustrations have descriptive alt text (e.g., “Smiling owl with glasses, holding a book”).
- Stories are summarized in text for users who prefer reading over visuals.

*Storytelling isn’t an add-on; it’s woven into every part of Mentora for emotional connection and better learning outcomes.*
