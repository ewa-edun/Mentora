## 🧠 What is Mentora?

**Mentora** is a voice-first, emotion-aware AI assistant that helps students **study smarter, feel better**, and stay on track. It’s not just a chatbot — it’s a tutor, a wellness coach, a storyteller, and a friend.

In one voice-driven app, Mentora lets you:
- Learn from AI-generated summaries and quizzes
- Get **emotional support** through adaptive breaks
- Enjoy interactive storytelling and voice conversations
- Speak, scan, or upload your content and start learning
- Let your **mood** and progress shape the experience

## 🔥 Why Mentora?

Modern study tools are often:
- Text-heavy, generic, and impersonal
- Don’t care how you're *feeling*
- Hard to navigate without screens

We built **Mentora** to fix that.  
It's built to **listen**, **understand**, and **adapt** — all through **natural voice** and **emotion-aware interaction**.
